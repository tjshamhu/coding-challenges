In the heart of the forest, where pines once stood tall,
A silent sarcophagus, a concrete sprawl.
Chernobyl whispers, a name etched in fear,
A monument to man's ambition, both bold and unclear.

Reactor four, a heart of steel and might,
Unleashed a fury, burning through the night.
Radiation's fingers, unseen and untamed,
Across the land, a silent terror claimed.

Pripyat's streets, a playground of dust,
Where swings creak in silence, and memories rust.
A ghost town echoes with a phantom's tread,
A reminder of lives lost, the future left dead.

But nature reclaims, a resilient embrace,
Trees pierce the concrete, a verdant space.
Birdsong replaces the sirens' shrill cry,
A fragile hope whispers, beneath a radioactive sky.

Chernobyl, a scar on the Earth's embrace,
A cautionary tale, for the human race.
May we learn from the past, with wisdom and care,
And build a future, where such shadows are rare.
