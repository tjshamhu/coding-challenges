You are given an alien alphabet that happens to use the same characters in the english alphabet but in a different order.

Given a list of words, find out if the words are sorted in alphabetical order according to this alien alphabet

example:

    alphabet: 'huabcdefgijklmnopqrstvwxyz'
    words: ['hello', 'uber']
    You should output: true

    alphabet: 'worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz'
    words: ['word', 'world', 'row']
    You should output: false
